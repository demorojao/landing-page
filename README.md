Look at that "master" branch



CLONE LINKS:

HTTPS : https://github.com/demorojao/landing-page.git

SSH: git@github.com:demorojao/landing-page.git

GITHUB CLI : gh repo clone demorojao/landing-page 




Cloning with HTTPS URLs
https:// clone URLs are available in all repositories, regardless of visibility. https:// clone URLs work even if you are behind a firewall or proxy.

When you use git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push on a remote repository using HTTPS URLs on the command line, Git will prompt you for your GitHub username and password. When Git asks for your password, enter your personal access token. Alternatively, you can use a credential helper like Git Credential Manager. Git's password-based authentication has been removed to make way for more secure authentication methods. For more information, see "Manage your personal access tokens."

If you are accessing an organization that uses SAML SSO and using a personal access token (classic), you must authorize the personal access token to access it before authenticating. For more information, see "About authentication with SAML single sign-on" and "Authorize the use of a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on."

Tips:

You can use a credentials helper to have Git remember your GitHub credentials every time you talk to GitHub. For more information, see "Store your GitHub credentials in Git."
To clone a repository without authenticating to GitHub from the command line, use GitHub Desktop for cloning. For more information, see "Clone a GitHub repository to GitHub Desktop."
If you prefer to use SSH but cannot connect over port 22, use SSH over the HTTPS port. For more information, see "Use SSH on the HTTPS port."

Clone with SSH URLs
SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. To use these URLs, generate an SSH key pair on your computer and add the public key to your GitHub.com account. For more information, see "Connect to GitHub with SSH."

When you use git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push on a remote repository using SSH URLs, you will need to enter a password and provide your SSH key passphrase. For more information, see "Work with SSH key passphrase."

If you are accessing an organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO), you will need to authorize your SSH key to access the organization before authenticating. For more information, see "About authentication with SAML single sign-on" and "Authorize the use of an SSH key for use with SAML single sign-on" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

Tip: Use a URL with SSH to clone a repository on your computer or as a secure way to deploy your code to production servers. You can also use SSH agent forwarding with your deployment script to avoid managing keys on the server. For more information, see "Use SSH agent forwarding."

<n>Clone with GitHub CLI</n>
You can also install the GitHub CLI to use GitHub workflows on your terminal. For more information, see "About the GitHub CLI."
